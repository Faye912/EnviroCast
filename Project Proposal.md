# EchoRisk: Modeling Strategic Compliance Behavior and Policy Response Patterns with Ensemble Learning

## Overview
Environmental enforcement policies shape how industrial facilities respond to inspections, regulations, and compliance requirements. This project develops a time-varying risk model to forecast environmental noncompliance behavior using facility-level data from the U.S. EPAâ€™s Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) database. The goal is to capture dynamic, behavioral, and policy-driven patterns of strategic noncompliance and regulatory adaptation.

## Research Objectives
- Forecast environmental violation risk at the facility level.
  
- Detect strategic noncompliance timing (e.g., behavior shifts around inspection windows).
  
- Identify policy reaction effects (e.g., compliance changes after new rules).
  
- Analyze violation type transitions over time.
  
- Discover behavioral clusters across facilities with shared characteristics (industry, ownership, region).

## Approach
**Data Source**: EPA ECHO, including inspection records, violation reports, enforcement actions, and facility metadata.

**Modeling Strategy**: Ensemble-based forecasting using multiple base models (e.g., gradient boosting, time-series models, and neural nets).

**Temporal Focus**: Incremental training and fine-tuning to adapt to evolving regulatory and behavioral signals.

## Key Outputs:
- Facility-level dynamic risk scores

- Temporal compliance pattern visualizations

- Cluster-based risk analysis across facility cohorts
